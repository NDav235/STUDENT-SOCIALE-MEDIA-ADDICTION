# STUDENT-SOCIALE-MEDIA-ADDICTION
The Student Social Media &amp; Relationships dataset contains anonymous survey responses from students worldwide, tracking their social media habits (like usage time and favorite apps) and how these affect their personal lives. Each row represents one student's answers, making it useful for research.

## Overview
The Student Social Media & Relationships dataset includes anonymized survey responses capturing how students engage with social media and the effects on various aspects of their lives. Covering diverse countries and academic levels, it highlights important factors like time spent online, preferred platforms, and interpersonal relationships. Each entry reflects a single student's input, providing a cross-sectional view that supports both statistical evaluation and machine learning exploration.

## Objective of the project
To analyze and model the relationship between students social media usage patterns (such as intensity, platform preference) and their life outcomes (including relationship quality, academic performance, or emotional well-being), enabling data-driven insights for educators, counselors, and policymakers.
## Methodologies & Data collection
The dataset was initially sourced from Kaggle and subsequently imported into Microsoft Excel, where I carried out the entire process of data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard development.

Tools and techniques used:

To analyze and visualize the dataset effectively, several Microsoft Excel features were utilized:
- Pivot Tables: Enabled efficient grouping, summarization, and comparison of data across multiple categories, providing a clear overview of key variables.
-  Slicers: Served as interactive filters that allowed for dynamic data exploration, helping to isolate and examine specific segments such as academic levels, countries, or platform preferences.
- Charts and KPIs: A combination of charts and key performance indicators (KPIs) were employed to illustrate trends, highlight critical metrics, and support data-driven insights in the final dashboard.
## Observations
- The Perception Gap: The most critical insight is the disconnect between behavior and perceived harm. Despite high usage and addiction scores, the majority of students (65.74%) feel their academics are unaffected. This suggests a lack of awareness about the subtle effects of social media, like reduced attention span or poor sleep, on academic success.
- Undergraduate Vulnerability: Undergraduates are at the center of this issue. They have the highest aggregate usage (as seen in previous charts) and are the single largest group (50.07%) to report negative academic impact.
- Usage vs. Addiction: The most used platform (Instagram) is not the most addictive platform (TikTok). This distinction is vital; a platform’s popularity doesn’t solely determine its potential for harm. The design and content algorithm of platforms like TikTok appear to be more problematic.
- Impact Beyond Academics: The issue is not confined to the classroom. Social media is a significant source of personal conflict, especially for single students, highlighting its deep integration into students’ social lives.
